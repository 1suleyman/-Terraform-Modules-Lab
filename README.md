# -Terraform-Modules-Lab
In this lab, you learned how to use Terraform modules from the public registry, inspect their required arguments, override default behavior, and control which internal resources a module should create.  This includes reading module documentation, understanding module inputs/outputs, and customizing module behavior through arguments.
